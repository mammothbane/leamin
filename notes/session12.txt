- there are a couple of people preaching to the group about how the indilian mages are keeping critical information to themselves that could help keep people alive.
- guards tell them to fuck off.
- henri antagonizes them.
- ezra grabs the protestors and drags them away, henri sneaks away as well. everything is resolved more or less ok.
- we get back on the carriage and leave.
- there's a somewhat intersting exchange between henri and carriage man.
- we're informed of who the indilian big boys are:

Premier Wizard Silas Haraude 
Senior Magician Mortimer Dujardin (Valurex's boss)
Senior Magician Mason Summerwind
Senior Magician Thirya Sweetsong
Senior Magician Sibi Daladaln

- we hit a roadblock with some lizardfolk, who tenoch recognizes to be the civilized uryahd variety (as opposed to 'd'urys' barbarians). they say they want to go home and ask for supplies to help them on their way.
- tenoch exchanges words with them and agrees to give them money and provisions.
- about a week after we left we reach the capital. the ocean is behind it.
- general population lives in the periphery, with merchants in the next ring, then smaller universities, with the academy in the middle.
- we drive into the city, valurex produces a badge, and we're waved into the main campus.
- we stop at the divination tower and are asked to get out. we're greeted by a mage.
- we're brought to a lecture hall where there is someone speaking. he has a device in front of him that he's casting magic on.
- he extracts himself, brings us to his office, and identifies himself as dujardin.
- he tells us that the sundial is in terodaana, shears are in saelin, lantern is missing, focusing crystal in indilia. 
- we have seen visions of goblets, golden skulls, a harp, scales tipped unevenly. may represent other artifacts, be artifacts themselves, etc.
- we tell him we've interacted with gibbet. he's surprised and excited.
- we ask him where to start, but he doesn't know where to look for the lantern. the shears are in the saelin vaults.
- shit's been going down in saelin. there's a potential succession war on the horizon.
- he doesn't know what they do, but believes they're associated with appon. has heard rumors that they're "impossibly sharp".
- the party splits to go buy stuff. tenoch finds his helm, buys it back, and tries to repair it. needs to recover teeth that have been stripped off of it.
- everyone goes to bed, but wakes up to a buzzing, droning noise.
- it appears to be coming from henri's bag. he doesn't know what it could be, but eventually recognizes that it's the vial. it's really cold. the glass starts to crack, and something starts materializing around it. ezra swings at it, but misses. the vial shatters and the goo congeals into a ball.
- another shape materializes in the room and reaches out to grab the ball. ezra strikes at it and it screams when he hits it. shadowy shit comes out when he hits it. it grabs his forearm and hurts him. he gets transported into a space with a big boy with a white mask that tells him he's a worthless insect. he comes back right after.
- henri tries to heal him, but he's still in pain. veria tries to figure out what it is, but isn't sure. henri trances and sees some scarring, which resolves into a black and purple mark. henri trances again and recognizes it as gibbet's work.
