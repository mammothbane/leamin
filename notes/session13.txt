- the sky turns purple and lightning streaks across it, people are surprised
- blue lights descend from the sky into the city, and it gets chilly
- perceptrons can see silhouettes around them
- henri calls out to them in fake latin
- one of them slaps him, we beat them up
- another thunderclap strikes, with lightning centering around the academy
- henri talks to one of the spooky bois, a sidhe, who we determine has been forced here against its will. he grants it a boon of tongues and it just complains about how it's been here too long. the party goes to the academy.
- gates are shut with people crowded around, trying to get in.
- some guy is yelling about how the mages are being selfish.
- henri walks up and demands that he be let in with the sidhe for study, and they confer and decide that that makes sense. the party goes in.
- there's a field around the tower that's keeping the lightning away.
- valorex runs into us, asks about ezra's curse, we talk him through it and figure out that his ecto was also taken. show him the sidhe and tell him they only speak meme latin and are just trying to defend themselves. he takes us into the main admin building. the sidhe stops at the door.
- dujardin meets us, sees the sidhe, and we explain the situation. the keystone keeps shit out. it was created by the academy's founders. wants to add new magic to it to help the sidhe. hasn't been done before, is cautious.
- he shows us a map. there's a monument to one of the founding members of the academy. there are secrets there and it's heavily magically protected. we may need to bring something from the academy to prove association. he gives us one of his rings for this purpose.
- dujardin theorizes that ezra's curse is a link to gibbet and may be associated with the sidhe.
- we buy shit and head out through the woods to the tomb.
- meet some people in robes on the road that ask about news in the academy. we tell them that there is extraplanar shit going down and they thank us and keep going.
- we make it to a town eventually. tenoch goes to find a guy for teeth: corvin of the white fang gang. base of operations unknown but they are active in a swath between the southern border of indilia and this town.
- we wander out and bait them with a carriage disguised to look scuffed.

- more happened but i had to go.
