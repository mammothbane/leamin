Gibbet passage from the grim trio
A priest will tell you not to fear death, for death is as natural as life. A priest will tell you to fear decay and sickness, as your body begins to waste away before the end. This middle ground, between life and death, is Gibbet's diseased kingdom.

Gibbet, god of Disease and Decay, is perhaps the most common diety of the Grim Trio, and works opposite the teachings of Dinat the Inevitable and the Divine Circle as a whole. Temples to Gibbet are few and far between, located in dark alleyways or forgotten crypts, far away from the dignified stone walls of civil faith. Some who study necromancy abandon the balance Dinat teaches, seeking shortcuts and crude solutions to life and death, treating the two as idle playthings rather than as pieces of the universe's divine order.

And yet, Gibbet has his uses. The bodies of executed criminals and evil men are hung on display, gibbeted as warnings for those who would stray from The Divine Circle's table. Some are even so bold as to suggest Gibbet exists within Dinat as the unfortunate but necessary bridge between life and death.
