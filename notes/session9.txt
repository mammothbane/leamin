- A plague cure has been synthesized and is being distributed to the population
- The party chats about their plans, but there isn't much consensus about what to do next. Ezra wants to go to Saelin to kill the king, who has hurt his family's reputation. Much of the rest of the group wants to go to Indilia to investigate the cult they've been fighting further.
- Henri chats with Jonathan again, who arranges to give him a handy haversack and a scroll of zone of truth for Barent.
- Tenoch looks around for a shaman or a druid to commune with, doesn't have much success in the city but gets directed to a dude in the foothills.
- As we're preparing to leave the city, Jonas shows up an picks us up in a carriage. He explains that the lantern is a magical artifact of which they've maintained custody for many years. It grants vague knowledge in exchange for sacrifice. It disappeared last night.
- He thinks the goblets are real artifacts, similar to the lantern. He knows of one other, known as the sundial, which is in Terodaana. It is an Ai-El artifact, which has never been used, but is believed to have some connection to time.
- He also mentions that he's seen silver shears in visions as well, which could be another artifact. Pair of swords in a golden field, sun directly above it, oscillating.
- We used to be the prime suspects for the disappearance of the lantern, but we're apparently not anymore. He's asking for our help.
- Ezra mentions that he found a secret exit from the city through the catacombs.
- Cleric man was visited by Ai-El, who showed him the lantern and quickly hid it. He saw a manor estate as well.
- Ezra mentions that he wants to go kill the king of Saelin in the presence of Jonas, who is shocked but seems cool with it once we say it'll be through a duel.
- Jonas wants us to collect the relics and bring them to Terodaana with the sundial.
- More potential artifacts have been seen: pile of golden skulls, unevenly tilted scales
- We're leaving the city and they give us all a dose of plague cure and a potion of remove disease
- Jonas is going back to Terodaana, to the city Divetan.
- We strike out towards Indilia.
- We make camp after the first day. Barent takes the first watch and the camp soon melds into swampy muck garbage. He wakes everyone up and it seems like Gibbet's realm. A path appears through the muck. Ezra walks down it, Barent follows, and everyone else comes along too. There's a thing ahead. As everyone approaches, they find a ship sunk into the muck. Veria finds a name on the hull with letters missing: F _ L _ _ N
- Henri detects a lot of evil inside the ship. Barent knocks on the door of the captain's cabin and there's a chest with evil inside. There's a broken lock on it. He opens the chest, which disintegrates into dust and reforms into a harp with hair strings.
- Ezra goes to touch it but it falls apart.
- We leave the ship and continue down the path. We run into a bunch of skulls hanging from the trees, all golden. They're not very evil. Seem to be human and elf with a few exceptions. They're just gilded, not solid gold.
- Everyone except Barent takes skulls. Veria and Henri just take a few between them, and Tenoch and Ezra take as many as they can carry. As Tenoch is putting them in his bag, they start humming. We stack all of them together and they start humming louder and louder, until they resolve to chanted music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNKB6urTSFg
- Ezra recognizes it as a popular hymn in Terodaana and Saelin most closely associated with Ai-El. As the song concludes, there's a light at the top of the pile and an image of a golden cup, which fades once everything's done.
- The party picks skulls back up and continues on.
- Triangular spikes of obsidian appear on either side of the path, seemingly in no particular pattern. Eventually we reach one in the middle of the path, about 5' tall with an obisidian skull sitting on it. Detects as evil. Spooky sparks run up and down the pillar, which Veria thinks are some kind of magical energy, but without any particular focus or refinement.
- We continue on, and the path widens. There's a stone fence up ahead with metal on top. Covered in hostile-looking vines and ivy. Gate is closed with a figure standing in front of it. Black robes + smooth mask. Duplicates somehow and opens the gate.
- Henri pokes the duplicate, no response. Pulls the mask off, and there's just a shadowy mass inside.
- We go through the gate. There's a cobblestone path with a fountain. There's a large manor in the middle being overtaken by vines. Seems similar to the one Jonas described.
- Gibbets all around, all filled with bones. Bones strewn about in the front yard. 2 more masked figures at the base of the steps up to the manor. 2 more open the front door.
- Double doors at the end of the hallway with smaller doors on either side. Ezra breaks one down and goes flying out the one on the other side.
- Barent knocks on the double doors, which open to a ballroom with masked figures. There's a stage with a lantern on it. Tenoch tries to pick up the lantern but his hand passes through it.
- The doors slam shut behind us, with a figure in front of it, beaked mask with a big hat. We ask him why he brought us into his realm.
- He wants us here as guests of honor, warns Tenoch not to touch the lantern again.
- He wants to thank us, says the information we've gotten is a reward.
- He starts rambling, picks up the lantern, and the light grows to blinding and we're back in the woods, seemingly right at the moment we left.
- We sleep and head off.
- 5 more days pass and we arrive at a small hamlet at the base of the mountains.
- Tenoch talks to the villagers who direct him to druids who have been harassing the mine they maintain.
- We go talk to them. After some negotiation, they agree to talk to us and we hand over our weapons.
- We go talk to head druid man. He tells us the mountain is going to collapse as a result of the mine and they couldn't reason with the townsfolk. He claims they were also directly attacked when they arrived and tensions started running high.
- We talk to the mayor, Abel, to talk about the mine and the druid issues. Barent suggests that he can take a look and they eventually convince the mayor that this is a good idea. We go down to the mine and take a look, and Henri figures out that it is in fact quite bad. We tell him this and he seems to be receptive.
