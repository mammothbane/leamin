NOTE:

Numlash, your title is well earned.

Your job is simple enough that a child could do it. All I want is for the bodies to be intact. do you understand what "intact" means? It means no missing limbs or fingers whatsoever.

You can keep all the worthless items you want from the dead but leave their bodies for me. Any future mistakes and I might forget our little arrangement. I might use your body instead.

Why not keep this note close by as a reminder of your incompetence?

-Mayes
