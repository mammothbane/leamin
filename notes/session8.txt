- We continue into the catacombs and follow the path with the most traffic
- Run into a dormant skellington that we kill
- Come to a split where there seems to be traffic from somewhere else, we cast alarm
- We make it into the altar chamber from a couple of sessions ago, but it's been emptied
- We exit via the monument of heroes, and someone calls out to us and tells us to halt
- Ezra chats with him as everyone else is exiting from the trap door, and he identifies himself as Head Priest Jonas
- The inquisition is a long way off
- We tell him that Ryker is fucked; he says he's taking over
- He suggests that publicly execute Olivier to make an example of him
- Henri backs out quietly and goes back through the catacombs to find a cultist to make sure he's not going to burn them at the stake
- Runs into a paladin and explains what's going on
- Henri says he wants to rip information from their brains, paladin ensures them that there's one they can use "the lantern" on, which he wasn't supposed to mention
- We go back to the church of Si, and there are more sick-looking people when we enter
- We ask priestess-lady where Ryker is; he's in the back coughing
- We decide we could go to the mages' college to a professor (Jonathan), who the priestess suggests
- We put Ryker in Barent's pot and head off to the college
- Walking by the monument of heroes we see a cart being guarded by some paladins
- It's magical but there seems to be some sort of dead zone, seems like anti-magic zone
- Tiny team goes on to the college, big team stays with the cart
- Tiny team sees an architecturally weird building (walled off with a gate); it's the Indilian Embassy
- Some bois outside the college with light armor outside and hoods (amber-brown) stop them
- We hand off the samples + Ryker to the guards after telling them what it is
- Tiny team meets back up with the other 3
- Veria walks up to the cart says that we're with the church of Si and have been asked to escort the shipment
- As people are winding down, Henri and Barent go back to the college, eventually getting past the guards and going to Professor Jonathan Brant
- He and Henri talk and work on the plague, and they discuss a way to split the magical enhancement from the plague
- Begin work on a counter-plague
- Barent looks around for scrolls or people to meet but doesn't find anything
- They go back and sleep

- There are less and less people out and about, and there are whispers of disease/plague, but seemingly no panic
- Announcement of public execution, which we go to attend
- There's a stage with a big box (painted with a big 'I' on all sides) and a raised section in front of it
- Armored cart comes into the plaza from the south, escorted by pallies. Jonas steps out, wearing a clerical hat, and leading a sack-wearing person. He makes a speech saying that a cure has been found and a perpetrator located. Meme boy is secured to the stage and they start moving lenses into place and he starts burning.
- Henri rips information from his brain.
- A hook drops down from the top of the tower, and they put burnt Olivier in a cage and hook him on. He's lifted up and put on display.
- Another similar cart comes forward and they both head northeast.
- We discuss what to do at this point and go to the holding cells to interrogate cultists.
- Ask paladin standing by what he knows, Henri name-drops the lantern. He pulls us aside and asks what we know. We don't know much, but can extrapolate a decent amount.
- Jonas requested the lantern yesterday.
- The lantern is powered by life energy.
- The vision that was produced was a vision of 3 goblets filled with a dark red liquid. One was of gold, and one was of iron, and one was of wood.
- Paladin pulled up a fragment of a poem from scripture: The wars begun, the guilty hung / Three goblet full of blood
- The full thing is:
	The wars begun, the guilty hung
	Three goblets full of blood

	The mind is sick with some new trick
	The mask knows not its face

	A scattered life, an age of strife
	A door with broken locks

	The world if frail, yet some prevail
	The Serpent eats its tail.
- Tenoch asks if there has been any theological analysis of this poem, but it has thus far been interpreted as general.
- We go to interrogate the man. Barent stares at him, Tenoch gets up in his personal space, and threatens him. He tells us that the cult has largely left the city through the catacombs.
- Ezra leaves to go find the exit through the catacombs, which he finds within a few hours. He leaves without specific plans to exit the city.
- Tenoch goes to the gym.
- Henri, Veria, and Barent go to the mages' college. Henri works on the plague, Veria researches sorcerer stuff, and Barent learns some spells.
- Everyone at the college also notices the second cart from the execution, which has some basic abjuration magic on it.
- Barent meets Dr. Lorelai Telyese.
- After learning his first spell, Barent meets Dr. Knilnaihillenille, a gnome, who is here from the Indilian Consulate to help with the plague cure.
- Veria also bumps into another doctor, Felix Valentino, from Indilia, while researching sorcerer stuff.
- Tenoch goes to the temple of Si to ask for payment, gets redirected to Lord Stoneridge, who gives them a lot of money.
- Henri accuses his doctor lady of not being totally forthcoming in her goals, since she just showed up when a cure appeared.
