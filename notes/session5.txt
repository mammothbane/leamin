# spook factor 10

- on the outskirts of whitepeak, largest city in the southern grivian empire, fairly close to indilian border
- seems similar to aldenburn
- city is on a hill, on top of which is a tall, cylindrical tower, with no visible windows, except at the very top. kind of looks like a lighthouse hundreds of miles inland.
- main gates at the walls are closed--there is a checkpoint at a smaller visitor gate with a large line
- we get into line and overhear that this is because of the war, wonder if it's because they're not grivian
- ezra steps out of line and heads to the front, flashes a seal and is waved along
- he asks if his "servants" can come in, guard allows the rest of the group in too, but names are recorded
- group aruges about how to approach a search for cultists
- henri argues we should split up so that we're not all associated with either the general population or the guard
- the lord of the city, Lord Stoneridge, is not very high-ranking, and claims to represent the working man, but is out of touch
- there seems to be more magical presence, various people remember that whitepeak used to be indilian, but was lost to the grivian empire a long time ago. the empire turned it into a magical center, but it also suffers from proximity because most serious mages will just be in indilia
- whitepeak university
- we decide to split up: veria, barent, and henri to the meme wizards, and ezra and tenoch are going to the authority
- ezra points towards a guardpost, suggesting they go there, but tenoch questions this because it seems too indirect/they won't take it seriously
- ezra and tenoch try to find the HQ. they ask someone, and they get pointed to the nearest barracks.
- the person they ask gives them a weird send-off (hope you find who you're looking for)
- they get to the barracks and there's a posting board with a lot of missing persons posters
- they go in, there's a receptionist and a dormitory nearby
- receptionist looks bored, directs them to a form for missing persons
- tenoch says they have information: in oakstone, they uncovered a cult that captured people in the name of gibbet, and there's another branch in whitepeak
- receptionist seems taken aback, tenoch presents mask and cloak and points out that unholy gibbet symbols may also be found
- receptionist gets his boss, who is a tall boi with chainmaille and a tabard
- boss asks for the information, they relate it again
- he's thinking, eventually asks if they're registered with the adventuring guild, and ezra and barent are
- reminds them not to break the law in the name of the law
- bossboi is captain bradford
- ezra is falling asleep

## cut to memelads
- barent remembers some magical knowledge, they go nearby the university, where there is a small plaza with a cloaked figure holding up a lantern
- see some storefronts and sellers, with a smaller branch off towards side streets, see a sketchy man with a wart on his nose and a gnarled staff entering a store called dixon's apothecary
- we enter an alley, and it gets unreasonably dark all of a sudden
- there's a man sitting outside of a signless storefront with broken windows and a shut door, confronts barent asking if they're lost
- barent says no, they're looking around and have some items they'd like to get rid of
- barent doesn't trust him initially, but they go in to the building, sell an infernal healing
- barent asks for an interrogation scroll, but the guy asks too much. he ends up buying a cure light wounds.
- henri finds a tiny silver raven figurine, thinks it's a summon monster that must be a raven
- they chat, the dude says a guy with a mask sold it a few days ago, he sold some other necromantic stuff
- henri buys it for evidence

## together at the inn
- they meet up at an inn
- henri wakes up in the middle of the night, and there's a bird looking at him, he greets it in every language he knows
- it responds in infernal, saying it was in henri's pocket all day
- it just wanted to get a good look at him
- henri asks what it's thinking
- it just wanted to get a good look
- they wake up the next day, henri tells them what happened
- got o chapel to si (?) the gifted to find someone to scry on the statuette for them
- on the way they decide ezra is the best person to lead the conversation
- they argue about it but decide si is the best deity to go to
- ezra mentions the cult to the priestess, says they're the only people we could turn to, asks for scrying
- she leads us to the altar, ezra presents the thing, and she pulls out a mirror and scries
- we see an elf dude in the merchant district setting up a wagon--henri makes a sketch an thinks it's quite similar to his previous sketch of olivier
- he's selling basic magical goods, all marked with an indilian insignia
- she's disturbed but glad the church knows now
- party asks for some time to bring him in

## merchant district
- we go to the merchant district and look around
- it's busy, but we find him
- the plan is to roll him up into the tent
- veria walks up to him and says she has a note that she thinks he should read
- he responds asking if there's anything she's looking for
- she hands him a sealed letter
- he pockets it and says it's unfortunate that he doesn't have what she was looking for
- as veria and henri walk away, he opens the letter and reads it, then crumples it up, and it smokes briefly and burns up
- he turns to veria, who has stopped and is looking vaguely in her direction, and waves her over
- they exchange words, and veria successfully convinces him that she wants to join the cult
- he invites her to talk at the inn he's staying at
- they walk into the alley that people are hiding in
- he stops in the alley as barent evil eyes from the crowd, looks angrily at veria and asks who sent her
- tenoch sneaks up right behind him and smacks him
- we beat him into submission and roll him up into the large tent
- we open up his cart with a little difficulty, roll it into the alleyway, and put him into it
- veria disguises it (covers insignia and stuff)
- tenoch drags it outside the city, and they have very little trouble getting past the walls
- we find another robe and mask and loot the wagon
- 6x each prestidigitation, mending
- 3x each grease, true strike
- 2x campsite feather tokens
- 4x potion clw
- wand of magic missile (10 charges)
- henri heals him and wakes him up
- ezra accuses him of crimes against the empire, which he denies
- we search him and check his pockets
- henri just asks him a bunch of places where he might live
- henri pulls the bird out of his pocket, olivier recognizes it and asks where he got it
- the bird asked olivier to leave it at the store
- veria detects magic on the bird and recognizes a lot of necromantic energy, is worried about keeping it around
- ezra asks it what it thinks of him, but it doesn't respond
- henri enters a trance focused on the bird, and comes to realize that it's a symbol of gibbet, has heard of the concept of an avatar, but doesn't know if the bird is one
- henri keeps asking it things, and it doesn't say anything
- he asks olivier if he was keeping an avatar of gibbet in his pocket
- olivier doesn't know
- tenoch grabs the bird and asks in draconic how it would feel about being cut to ribbons
- the bird responds in draconic 'you could try. i wouldn't mind much'
- henri mentions that damage to him as a summoned creature shouldn't damage his true form
- henri casts clw on the raven and the bird asks him to stop
- henri suggests that we could use discern next of kin
- he doesn't want to die if the soul goes where it goes where he thinks it does
- he's a courier who was instructed to drop off the bird at the store after he dropped off some parcels at the monument of heroes (the big tower)
- he dropped off a parcel, left, and dispatched the group that came to kill us (he passed along the order)
- he won't tell us where the dead drops are
- group talks about what to do with him, consider giving him up to the church
- argue for a while what to do
- the bird offers a deal to work for it
- we snark at it
- olivier disintegrates
- the world has changed, we're on gibbet's spooky demiplane and he becomes deer skull dangerboi
- ezra asks for seats and he creates them out of nothing
- gibbet sits down on a throne
- tenoch attacks him, but misses, keeps attacking, starts chanting and eventually gets silenced
- henri asks what the job is
- gibbet says he gives us instructions, and we carry them out
- the first one would be to make an example of olivier
- the next would be to investigate the monument of heroes
- he wants to reshape the world in a significant way
- henri asks if gibbet would be interested in improving freedom of information
- gibbet doesn't care
- ezra asks for control of gibbet's plane as a reward
- gibbet says not to get greedy
- henri says we don't seem to have common interests, but we should check back in later
- it requires some effort on gibbet's part to bring us there
- we get sent back, henri reflects on how much effort it actually takes to not get yoinked to the planes, recognizes that it's a matter of balance between the good gods and the evil ones, so he can probably do it whenever, more or less, as long as he's not causing huge issues

> Olivier,

Mayes fucked up. He got the bright idea of raising a couple of farmers as undead right after their kid hired a bunch of adventurers to heal them. They ended up following his trail all the way back to Oakstone to grab a bounty for a “dangerous necromancer.” By the time they were done, Mayes was dead, his goblin lackeys were slaughtered, and the local cleric found and desecrated Gibbet’s altar. Mayes almost took me down with him - he called for me to help him, in front of one of the adventurers, right after showing his face and right before leading them to the altar. If anyone else had heard him, I’d be stuck in jail right now. I’ll need to lay low here for a while, to let the heat die down and get a chance to rebuild.

The adventurers themselves are the only good things to come out of the whole thing. The sorcerer who heard Mayes sought me out after the battle with their witch and oracle, not to turn me in, but learn more about our organization for themselves. None of them are worshippers of the lesser gods, none of them suffer from the sorts of… hangups which can turn people away from our cause, and they were all receptive to what pieces of our philosophy I shared. They all have tremendous potential, but the situation here is too delicate for me to handle it myself; please, find someone to initiate them properly.

Thank you,
-Blanche
