=======

Gibbet’s Blight: a disease based off of the mundane disease known as Gibbet’s Rot, magically enhanced with Necromantic magics designed to hinder disease-curing spells.

Symptoms: Initially inflicts the patient with fevers, weakness, and dehydration, worsening over time. Eventually, the disease’s effects spread to the patient’s mind, inflicting delirium, dementia, and other assorted mental maladies, which also grow worse with time. If left untreated, these gradually mounting symptoms will result in death.

Lethality: High.

Timeframe: The disease lies dormant for 2-3 days, before the first symptoms start to appear. From there, the symptoms worsen until the patient dies in around 7 days.

Transmissibility: Moderate. Can be spread through the air, but is not particularly virulent through this vector - simple distance and basic sanitation will thwart it. However, it is highly transmissible through direct contact or fluid exchange, so good sanitary practice is essential to avoid infection when handling patients.

Treatment: Should clerical aid be unavailable, Gibbet’s Rot is generally treated mundanely through sanitary practice and miscellaneous natural medicines, with… some success. As clerical aid is unreliable in the treatment of the enhanced Gibbet’s Blight, either superior mundane medicines or some method of dispelling or bypassing the Blight’s necromantic magics will be necessary to treat any significant body of patients.
