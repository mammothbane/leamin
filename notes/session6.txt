- henri drops the name of gibbet, explains what we've been up to
- barent gets the impression that he hasn't been entirely truthful, presses him somewhat
- tenoch walks over as we're talking and figures this out as well, intimidates him by mentioning that we hurt all the cultists that get into our way
- he whimpers and eventually reveals that the dead drop might be in the catacombs, which is behind the altar
- barent releases carl outside to patrol around the tower and keep watch on the trapdoor to make sure we're not getting memed

- enter a small dark room with 4 hallways
- lots of bodies all around with arms across their chest
- henri recalls that these catacombs are filled with generals and notable warrirors throughout the history of grivian-owned 
- we make a few turns and come across a skellington laid to rest while standing, dressed like a contemporary guard

- they're now northeast and southwest of us
- we wait a minute and re-cast detect magic

- he was in oakstone, got the cart working, stole a horse from a farm and put it on the cart, then came to whitepeak
- veria detects magic and finds more auras
- zelvar finds tracks going west, in which direction we go

- when we make it out, there are guards at the exit
- we explain what happened
- bradley and mary are the prisoners
