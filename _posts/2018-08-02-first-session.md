#### It is the 14th of Ai-El; a Càirnday with hardly a cloud in the sky. The year is 834.

The Grivian Empire is a proud and mighty Empire, led by His Imperial Majesty Olyn Solian IV. The year is young, 
and festivals for the harvest have begun to be celebrated across the land,  but rumors have already begun to 
plague 3 every inn and tavern across this glorious Empire.

To the north, dwarven soldiers from the Kingdom of Dwarmak have begun to rapidly mobilize towards the western 
coast. The Elves of Sylath watch from the shadows of the Scarletwood, caught between Dwarmak and the Empire.

To the south, the mages of Indilia meddle with arcane forces beyond their understanding, and travellers from the 
swampy forests of Uryahd bring with them rumors of brewing unrest and rebellion. In the Stony Sea, pirates sail 
the oceans, venturing forth from their secret ports and lawless havens. Bandits and brigands watch the roads, 
hoping to steal from any poor soul they find.

Across the Brinewater, the Kingdom of Sealan hoards its gold to be divided among an increasingly irritable royal 
family. All the while, the holy teachings of the Grand Temple in Terodaana seem to fall on increasingly uncaring 
ears.

There has been no word of the diplomats sent some time ago to the Kingdom of Dwarmak, and the Arch-General, 
Elijah Farellian, Guildmaster of The Imperial Guild of Military and Defence, has promised to deliver a swift 
justice to the Empire’s enemies. He has summoned the Empire’s forces to Grivia, where the Empire will bless 
their campaign against Dwarmak.

Trouble brews at the edges of the Empire, but the violence and chaos of this world are held back by the strength 
of the Imperial Guilds and the wisdom of our Emperor. But make no mistake, when the Imperial armies march north 
to Dwarmak the world will be reminded that the Grivian Empire stands at the center of this land.

These troubled times will be met by heroic individuals. The road is open, and the world is yours.

### Aldenburn
In the city of Aldenburn in the Grivian Empire, an army prepares to march to war. According to the crowds that have 
gathered to watch, they’ll meet up with Arch-General Farellian in Grivia along with armies from across the Empire, and 
he’ll lead them to Dwarmak to confront the dwarven kingdom; considering the hostility between the two nations, this will 
almost certainly turn into all-out war. The army leaving Aldenburn is led by one of Farellian’s sons, with the other 
left in charge of the city.
 
Five adventurers happen to meet by chance as they’re swept up in the crowd: Tenoch, a lizardfolk barbarian from Uryahd; 
Henri Shortfellow, a halfling oracle from Indilia; Barent Lockerhelm, a dwarf witch from Dwaeval; Zelvar Hutha, an elf 
ranger from Sylath; and Veria Tenumbri, a human sorcerer from Aldenburn itself. As Tenoch turns to leave since he 
doesn’t speak a word of Common, he bumps into a small child, who drops a couple bags of coins on the ground. He tries to 
get Tenoch’s attention, and a nearby shopkeeper offers to translate into Draconic for him. The child explains that he’s 
looking for a group of adventurers to help him get back to his family; he left to get medicine since his parents were 
very sick. Veria, who’s uncomfortable with the crowd’s overall conversation about the war, overhears, and offers to help 
the child, since she’s heading south anyway and needs money for travel. Henri, Zelvar, and Barent offer to help as well, 
and Tenoch manages to convey that he’ll let the child (whose name is Rowan) ride on his back during the journey. Rowan 
climbs up and the unlikely group heads out, toward a guard checkpoint at the southern edge of the city. 

At the checkpoint, the guards seem to be looking at a list and checking everyone who goes by. Veria attempts to disguise 
herself by seeming as inconspicuous as possible, not wanting to be recognized by anyone who might know her. The guards, 
however, stop Tenoch and Rowan. After retrieving another guard who speaks Draconic, the first guard asks to search their 
belongings, and when Rowan tries to protect a small bag he’s carrying, a vial of healing potion falls out and shatters 
on the ground. The guard explains that earlier that day someone stole from a shopkeeper, and he clearly believes that 
Rowan’s the thief. The boy doesn’t exactly do a great job of defending himself at this accusation, but Henri steps up 
and tells the guard that he’s an alchemist who offered to help the boy with his sick parents, and that he’s the one who 
gave him the vial. The guard believes him, and the group is allowed to leave the city. 

Rowan apologizes, and explains that he only stole because he’s so worried about his parents. Henri basically says that 
he understands and that Rowan should just have a better excuse next time. 


### Beyond the walls
As they continue down the road, Tenoch is naturally moving much faster than the others, and Rowan has to motion for him 
to slow down. Still in the lead, Tenoch then is surprised by a small goblin lurking in the bushes, who’s clearly 
interested in what valuable goods they might be carrying. Tenoch is unable to understand what the goblin says, but he 
roars at it, and it runs away terrified back to a group of three other goblins, who were waiting to ambush the 
travelers. Two of the four goblins have crossbows, while the others have swords. Tenoch leaps over a fallen tree in the 
middle of the road and absolutely destroys one of the crossbow-wielding goblins. Veria attempts to hit one of the sword 
goblins with her longsword and misses, and the goblin is much more successful in retaliation. Veria yells in pain and 
transforms into a demon-like version of herself, with horns and weird eyes and so on, and attacks the goblin with her 
new claws. Meanwhile, Barent hits a goblin over the head with his warhammer, Henri heals Veria who then kills the goblin 
she’d been fighting using the spell Chill Touch, and Tenoch charges at the second crossbow goblin. Ripping that goblin 
apart, Tenoch then throws his corpse at the goblin Barent hit, and that goblin surrenders, terrified. 

The group interrogates the remaining goblin after finding a note that says ‘block the road, ambush travellers, destroy 
this note after you read it’ and they ask him who his boss is. He says his boss is Numlash the Irritable, and Henri 
briefly goes into a trance state to piece together everything he can about Numlash. It turns out that the goblin leader 
isn’t necessarily the most powerful or anything, but he’s decently well-known and, well, he’s irritable. Zelvar finds 
some herbs while searching the goblins, but it turns out they’re mostly just useless plants. There’s a total of 30 gold 
that gets split amongst the party. Rather than killing the goblin, everybody decides to take the goblin with them to use 
him in a later battle against Numlash, and this leads to Tenoch carrying both Rowan on his back and the goblin under his 
arm. 

When they get to Rowan’s farm, a horrible sight awaits them. All the livestock are scattered around the property, dead, 
with large pools of blood. Zelvar notices strange bite marks on the animals. The house is empty; Rowan’s parents are 
gone, but there’s no sign of corpses or blood or anything in the house, just that it looks like somebody left in a 
hurry. Barent sends his hawk familiar, which kinda grows out of his back and is named Carl, out to scout. Veria asks 
Rowan what kind of sickness his parents had, and he explains that his sister ran away a few days ago, and his father was 
angry but they couldn’t go search for her because that’s when they started getting sick. His father started coughing up 
blood, raving in his sleep, not seeming like himself, etc. When Veria searches the house, she finds a note in the 
sister’s room that says ‘I am so sorry.’ Tenoch heads for the barn, still carrying the goblin. He hears chewing noises 
from inside, so he roars and charges in. 

A zombie is eating a horse on the floor of the barn, and when it sees Tenoch it charges at him. Tenoch drops the goblin, 
rips through the zombie easily with his claws, and then picks up the goblin again. Everybody else arrives, having heard 
Tenoch’s roar, to find the dead zombie, apart from Rowan who stays outside. Unfortunately, that’s not the only zombie. 
Another one is found in a side room, also eating a horse, and Zelvar attacks it with his scimitar. Veria shoots a Magic 
Missile at the zombie, but it attacks Zelvar in retaliation, and he falls to the ground unconscious. Tenoch drops the 
goblin again, stands over Zelvar and easily dispatches the second zombie, and then picks up the goblin again. Henri 
heals Zelvar. 

Rowan is distraught, since these zombies were his parents. Veria stays outside with him while the others search the 
barn. They find more dead horses and a chest with 300 gold and some personal items, and they bring both the gold and the 
items to Rowan, who seems slightly comforted. Barent casts detect magic before heading up to the upper loft of the barn, 
and he senses a faint aura. Up in the loft, there’s a ritual circle, which Henri identifies as a circle of Animate Dead, 
but very shoddily made, as if the caster didn’t really know what they were doing. As Barent and Henri desecrate the 
circle, they and Zelvar speculate that the sister probably had something to do with this, which Veria agrees with when 
they tell her what they found after leaving the barn. Zelvar attempts to track which way Rowan’s sister went, and the 
group follows that trail into some paths in the woods to the south that Rowan says they were told to never go to since 
they’re dangerous. The group camps for the night in the woods, needing to heal a bit and regain spell slots. They tie up 
the goblin for the night, and the next morning they leave him tied up while Tenoch carries him.

### The next day
Veria talks to Rowan in the morning about his sister. Rowan’s a half-elf, and for age he’s about the equivalent of a 
13-year-old human. His sister, Aida, is older than him; she’s a young adult now, and she’s run away multiple times. 
She didn’t want to be a farmer. Rowan’s brothers went off to war, and though Aida wanted to leave she didn’t want to 
become a soldier either. She often wandered where she wasn’t supposed to, and their parents didn’t like her friends.

The group continues down the forest paths. The goblin starts saying that they shouldn’t be here, and Tenoch drops the 
goblin so that he can lead them to wherever it is he doesn’t want them to go. Eventually they reach a goblin ‘border,’ 
with a skull hanging from some trees and crude paintings of goblins on trees and rocks and stuff. The group decides to 
go find Numlash, but Veria reminds them that they can’t just take Rowan into danger. They decide to leave him up in a 
tree, probably, and continue on their way, saying they’ll be back for him.

Tenoch holds the goblin over his head and yells ‘Numlash!” a lot, which gets the attention of a goblin sentry up in a 
tree. Henri casts Command on the goblin sentry and orders him to fall, so the sentry steps out of the tree and kind of 
splats on the ground, and the group prepares to go fight the goblin village.
