#### It is the 14th of Ai-El; a Càirnday with hardly a cloud in the sky. The year is 834.

The Grivian Empire is a proud and mighty Empire, led by His Imperial Majesty Olyn Solian IV. The year is young,
and festivals for the harvest have begun to be celebrated across the land,  but rumors have already begun to
plague 3 every inn and tavern across this glorious Empire.

To the north, dwarven soldiers from the Kingdom of Dwarmak have begun to rapidly mobilize towards the western
coast. The Elves of Sylath watch from the shadows of the Scarletwood, caught between Dwarmak and the Empire.

To the south, the mages of Indilia meddle with arcane forces beyond their understanding, and travellers from the
swampy forests of Uryahd bring with them rumors of brewing unrest and rebellion. In the Stony Sea, pirates sail
the oceans, venturing forth from their secret ports and lawless havens. Bandits and brigands watch the roads,
hoping to steal from any poor soul they find.

Across the Brinewater, the Kingdom of Sealan hoards its gold to be divided among an increasingly irritable royal
family. All the while, the holy teachings of the Grand Temple in Terodaana seem to fall on increasingly uncaring
ears.

There has been no word of the diplomats sent some time ago to the Kingdom of Dwarmak, and the Arch-General,
Elijah Farellian, Guildmaster of the Imperial Guild of Military and Defence, has promised to deliver a swift
justice to the Empire’s enemies. He has summoned the Empire’s forces to Grivia, where the Empire will bless
their campaign against Dwarmak.

Trouble brews at the edges of the Empire, but the violence and chaos of this world are held back by the strength
of the Imperial Guilds and the wisdom of our Emperor. But make no mistake, when the Imperial armies march north
to Dwarmak the world will be reminded that the Grivian Empire stands at the center of this land.

These troubled times will be met by heroic individuals. The road is open, and the world is yours.

### Aldenburn
In the city of Aldenburn in the Grivian Empire, an army prepares to march to war. According to the crowds that have
gathered to watch, they’ll meet up with Arch-General Farellian in Grivia along with armies from across the Empire, and
he’ll lead them to Dwarmak to confront the dwarven kingdom; considering the hostility between the two nations, this will
almost certainly result in all-out war. The army leaving Aldenburn is led by one of Farellian’s sons, with the other
left in charge of the city.

As the army departs, five adventurers are swept up together in the press of the civilian crowd:

- **Tenoch**, a lizardfolk barbarian from Uryahd
- **Henri Shortfellow**, a halfling oracle from Indilia
- **Barent Lockerhelm**, a dwarf witch from Dwaeval
- **Zelvar Hutha**, an elf ranger from Sylath
- **Veria Tenumbri**, a human sorcerer from Aldenburn

As Tenoch turns to move away from the group, he bumps into a small child, who drops a few bags of coins. The child tries
to get Tenoch's attention, but Tenoch doesn't speak a word of Common, so a nearby shopkeeper translates the boy's
entreaty&mdash;he is looking for a group of adventurers to aid his sick family. Tenoch says he will help, and the 
members of our nascent party overhear and offer to help as well: Veria, eager to leave the military ambience 
of the city square behind, indicates that she is moving south anyway and needs money to travel; Henri is interested in
expanding his knowledge (particularly of languages) and is determined to follow Tenoch, whose native Draconic and Uraydi 
have eluded him thus far; Barent simply wants a change of pace from lugging salted fish through the Grivian interior; 
and Zelvar is swayed by the boy's offers of coin and a vague sense of moral duty. The boy gives his name (Rowan),
and he climbs up onto Tenoch's back as the group sets out for a checkpoint at the city's southern wall.

The guards at the checkpoint are consulting a list as they examine departing travelers. Veria attempts to disguise
herself, fearing that she might be recognized. The guards, however, stop Tenoch and Rowan. An interpreter is found for
Tenoch, and the pair's bags are searched. Rowan defends a small knapsack, but loses control of it and drops a healing 
potion, which shatters on the ground. He is accused of stealing, as a shopkeeper reported a theft of such a potion by a 
young boy earlier that day. Rowan offers several poor excuses, but is saved by Henri, who claims that he is the 
alchemist who brewed the potion. The guards believe him, and in response to Rowan's apology for making such a mess, 
Henri only tells him to prepare a better excuse for the next time around.


### Beyond the walls
The party continues down the road, and Tenoch's long stride quickly outpaces that of the more vertically-challenged 
members of the group. Just as Rowan is suggesting that he slow down, a goblin appears from the bushes. Tenoch is unable 
to understand it, so he scares it off with a roar. The goblin scampers away, and as the rest of the adventuring group
catches up, several of them overhear muttering in the bushes. Four goblins leap out of the underbrush and set upon our
heroes. Two of them, further down the path, are armed with crossbows, and the near pair have swords.

Tenoch barrels past the sword-wielders and engages with the crossbowmen, while the rest of the party focuses on the
nearer foes. Veria slashes at one of them with a longsword, but misses and is stabbed for her trouble. She yells in pain
and begins to grow claws and horns, and her eyes begin to glow. She strikes back with her claws. Barent smacks a goblin 
over the head with his warhammer, and Henri, lagging behind, arrives in time to incant a healing spell for Veria. In 
this time, Tenoch has eviscerated his targets, and he throws one of the corpses at one of the remaining goblins. Veria 
finishes off her target, and the remaining greenskin surrenders, terrified.

Not yet committed to killing it, the group loots the corpses of its brethren and find a note that says:

> Blok de rode, inbush trabelers, ete dis noate wunse yu rede it.  
 

 
 interrogates this goblin after finding a note that says ‘block the road, ambush travellers, destroy
this note after you read it’ and they ask him who his boss is. He says his boss is Numlash the Irritable, and Henri
briefly goes into a trance state to piece together everything he can about Numlash. It turns out that the goblin leader
isn’t necessarily the most powerful or anything, but he’s decently well-known and, well, he’s irritable. Zelvar finds
some herbs while searching the goblins, but it turns out they’re mostly just useless plants. There’s a total of 30 gold
that gets split amongst the party. Rather than killing the goblin, everybody decides to take the goblin with them to use
him in a later battle against Numlash, and this leads to Tenoch carrying both Rowan on his back and the goblin under his
arm.

When they get to Rowan’s farm, a horrible sight awaits them. All the livestock are scattered around the property, dead,
with large pools of blood. Zelvar notices strange bite marks on the animals. The house is empty; Rowan’s parents are
gone, but there’s no sign of corpses or blood or anything in the house, just that it looks like somebody left in a
hurry. Barent sends his hawk familiar, which kinda grows out of his back and is named Carl, out to scout. Veria asks
Rowan what kind of sickness his parents had, and he explains that his sister ran away a few days ago, and his father was
angry but they couldn’t go search for her because that’s when they started getting sick. His father started coughing up
blood, raving in his sleep, not seeming like himself, etc. When Veria searches the house, she finds a note in the
sister’s room that says ‘I am so sorry.’ Tenoch heads for the barn, still carrying the goblin. He hears chewing noises
from inside, so he roars and charges in.

A zombie is eating a horse on the floor of the barn, and when it sees Tenoch it charges at him. Tenoch drops the goblin,
rips through the zombie easily with his claws, and then picks up the goblin again. Everybody else arrives, having heard
Tenoch’s roar, to find the dead zombie, apart from Rowan who stays outside. Unfortunately, that’s not the only zombie.
Another one is found in a side room, also eating a horse, and Zelvar attacks it with his scimitar. Veria shoots a Magic
Missile at the zombie, but it attacks Zelvar in retaliation, and he falls to the ground unconscious. Tenoch drops the
goblin again, stands over Zelvar and easily dispatches the second zombie, and then picks up the goblin again. Henri
heals Zelvar.

Rowan is distraught, since these zombies were his parents. Veria stays outside with him while the others search the
barn. They find more dead horses and a chest with 300 gold and some personal items, and they bring both the gold and the
items to Rowan, who seems slightly comforted. Barent casts detect magic before heading up to the upper loft of the barn,
and he senses a faint aura. Up in the loft, there’s a ritual circle, which Henri identifies as a circle of Animate Dead,
but very shoddily made, as if the caster didn’t really know what they were doing. As Barent and Henri desecrate the
circle, they and Zelvar speculate that the sister probably had something to do with this, which Veria agrees with when
they tell her what they found after leaving the barn. Zelvar attempts to track which way Rowan’s sister went, and the
group follows that trail into some paths in the woods to the south that Rowan says they were told to never go to since
they’re dangerous. The group camps for the night in the woods, needing to heal a bit and regain spell slots. They tie up
the goblin for the night, and the next morning they leave him tied up while Tenoch carries him.

### The next day
Veria talks to Rowan in the morning about his sister. Rowan’s a half-elf, and for age he’s about the equivalent of a
13-year-old human. His sister, Aida, is older than him; she’s a young adult now, and she’s run away multiple times.
She didn’t want to be a farmer. Rowan’s brothers went off to war, and though Aida wanted to leave she didn’t want to
become a soldier either. She often wandered where she wasn’t supposed to, and their parents didn’t like her friends.

The group continues down the forest paths. The goblin starts saying that they shouldn’t be here, and Tenoch drops the
goblin so that he can lead them to wherever it is he doesn’t want them to go. Eventually they reach a goblin ‘border,’
with a skull hanging from some trees and crude paintings of goblins on trees and rocks and stuff. The group decides to
go find Numlash, but Veria reminds them that they can’t just take Rowan into danger. They decide to leave him up in a
tree, probably, and continue on their way, saying they’ll be back for him.

Tenoch holds the goblin over his head and yells ‘Numlash!” a lot, which gets the attention of a goblin sentry up in a
tree. Henri casts Command on the goblin sentry and orders him to fall, so the sentry steps out of the tree and kind of
splats on the ground, and the group prepares to go fight the goblin village.
