We rejoin our heroes in the forest, preparing to enter the goblin camp where
they suspect they will find Numlash the Irritable, who their goblin prisoner
claims to work for. Henri has just killed a treeborne sentry with a Command
spell.

### The woods
The party begins walking down the road, and before long they hear
distant conversation and see smoke over the horizon. The more observant
members of the party can see a few short, green figures milling about in
the distance, if they strain their eyes.

To get a better perspective, Zelvar attempts to climb a tree, but he can't
find any obvious purchase, and circles the trunk a few times looking for a
way up. After watching Zelvar for a few moments, Tenoch throws his goblin
prisoner to the ground, pushes Zelvar aside, and grabs a high branch to pull
himself up. As he strains, a loud crack sounds, and he is on his back with a
tree limb in his claws. Henri steps around Tenoch, wraps his stubby arms and
legs around the trunk, and shimmies a bit, but can't seem to move more than
a few inches before falling off. Barent slams the pointed end of his
warhammer into the trunk above his head, drags himself up to eye-level with
it, then realizes he has no way to get any higher and lets himself down.
Veria and the still-hogtied goblin look on quizzically. After dusting
himself off, Tenoch finds a stronger branch and hauls his massive lizard
form up into the canopy, where he sees a rough camp in the distance at the
base of a cliff.

### Goblin camp
Tenoch descends from the tree, re-shoulders his prisoner, and starts walking
in the direction of the smoke. The rest of the group follows him, content to
trust his judgment. They approach within fifty feet of the camp, where
Tenoch halts and drops and ungags his hostage, who cowers beneath his
thoughtful gaze. From this vantage point, seven goblins are visible, milling
about a motley collection of tents and a pair of cookfires. Just behind the
camp yawns the dark mouth of a cave in the cliff face.

Veria focuses for a moment, her brow rumples, and she tells the group that
she can sense warding magic somewhere to the left of the cave's entrance.
Tenoch has been lost in thought for half a minute, but finally seems to
resolve to a course of action. He grabs his prisoner by the neck, roars in
his face, and lobs him in a soaring arc into the center of the camp. The
goblin screams the whole way, landing crumpled in a gibbering heap, and the
members of the party not already running into the camp see some of his
compatriots start to drag him back into the cave.

Per usual, Tenoch leads the charge. The group engages five goblins in the
camp, variously arrayed with knives and bows. Barent mutters a spell under
his breath and waves his hand, and one of the goblins stops in its tracks,
no longer aware of what it was doing. Before it can regain its composure,
Zelvar sprints forward and decapitates it. Now at the front of the group,
Zelvar and Tenoch are peppered with arrows slung by archers arrayed about
the near firepit. Enraged, Tenoch hooks his claws under a nearby goblin's
chin and rips its mandible right out of the socket; it falls over, gurgling
in pain. From behind a wall at the edge of the camp, Henri fires his
crossbow into the fray, but his shot goes wide and almost hits Tenoch.
Distracted by the bolt whizzing by his face, Tenoch is too late to stop a
goblin's dagger from punching through his thigh. Veria fires off two magic
missiles, one taking a goblin in the shoulder and the other slamming into
its another's gut, giving Zelvar an opportunity to impale it with his
scimitar. Barent rushes forward, incanting the same spell he cast before,
and arrests a goblin in its tracks, steps away from stabbing Tenoch in the
back. Tenoch spins around and rakes his claws across his would-be attacker's
face and chest, then grabs the hand still holding on to the dagger in his
leg. He lifts his assailant into the air and crushes its chest with his jaws.

The party pauses to breathe for a moment, having successfully annihilated
every goblin in sight. Before ten seconds pass, however, two more green
forms are sprinting out of the cave, daggers raised. They freeze in their
tracks when they see Tenoch's towering form lumbering towards them and the
carnage in his wake. Before the pair can decide what to do, Veria, Barent,
and Tenoch rush them. As they collide, Barent's warhammer slams into the
chest of the right-hand goblin, and Veria nearly cuts it in half. Tenoch's
claws rip the remaining enemy to shreds.

With no more enemies forthcoming from the cave, the party takes its time
picking through the spoils of their battle, finding a few handfuls of gold
and more ratty goblin gear, which Tenoch piles up in the center of the camp.
Henri intones a healing spell for each Tenoch and Zelvar, and the gravest of
their wounds disappear. While divvying up the gold, the party begins
discussing how much a single gold coin can buy, and realizes that despite their
shared desires for finely-crafted weapons and powerful magical reagents, a
good goat could be had in most towns for no more than 1gp&mdash;they might
be served well to take several hundred goats along to their next adventure.
It is decided that 'Gold Point' monetary denomination shall be rechristened
'Goat Points', to the amusement of all (save Tenoch, for whom even Henri's
gesticulations cannot suffice to convey the humor).

### Numlash's cave
Zelvar notices now that their former prisoner has crawled to the mouth of
the cave, perhaps in response to sounds of laughter about goats outside. He
points this out to the group, and they quickly recall their actual reason
for coming this way. The group approaches the cave entrance, and as their
eyes adjust to the dim light inside, a room takes shape, its walls and floor
hewn roughly out of the rock, the floor covered with all variety of items.
Four goblins watch them closely as they enter. One is their ex-prisoner, now
largely ignored as the group steps through into the cool underground air.
Another is tall for his race, perhaps four feet upright. The other two flank
the tall one with weapons drawn as he reclines in a once-ornate,
now-weathered armchair.

Focused on the goblin in the chair, Tenoch yells "NUMLASH!" at the top of
his lungs, pointing and flexing his claws. "Numlash? But *I'm* Numlash,"
the goblin says, visibly confused. Barent runs up to Tenoch and pulls on his
wrist, then utters a brief incantation. As he completes his spell, ~~Clarg~~
Numlash's grimace vanishes and his eyes refocus on Barent. "My friend! How
have you been?" he exclaims. Barent greets him warmly, and does his best to
convey to Tenoch that Numlash is not the primary target at the moment.
Clearly failing, he enlists Henri's help and returns his attention to
Numlash.

"I know we've known each other for the longest time and are quite good
friends, but you've never gone into detail into what it is exactly that you
do for work," Barent prods.

"Why yes, me and the boys, we liberate travelers of their funds and valuable
items, if you know what I mean. We have the greatest deal, you know. We just
have to put the bodies in the back, and we get to keep the rest," Numlash
replies.

By this point, both Tenoch and Numlash's bodyguards are chomping at the bit,
needing to visibly restrain themselves from aiming a blow at their
respective targets. Henri has done his best to pantomime Barent casting a
spell on Numlash to Tenoch, but it doesn't seem to be getting through, or
Tenoch just doesn't care&mdash;he still wants to kill the goblin as soon as
possible. Barent notices this and comes in close to stage-whisper to
Numlash, "I just remembered, friend, that we wanted to discuss something
with you in private. Would you mind sending your boys outside for a minute?"

"What *kind* of thing?" Numlash wonders, "What do you want to talk about?"

"Oh, you know, the stuff."

"Stuff? OH! *That* stuff. Yeah, guys, can you wait outside for a minute?" he
asks.

Puzzled, his lackeys lower their weapons and walk outside, glancing back every
few steps, fully expecting to see a pair of lizard arms descending towards their
heads each time they look. But they make it outside, and Barent and Henri pull
Tenoch aside. Barent points outside, and slides his finger across his throat.
Tenoch looks uninterested in the idea, points towards Numlash, and runs his own
finger across his throat. Henri shakes his head, holds up a finger to ask for
more time, then points at Numlash and repeats the gesture. Tenoch yells,
"NUMLASH!" and points towards the goblin. Numlash asks, "Is your name Numlash
too?"
