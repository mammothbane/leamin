We rejoin our heroes in the forest, preparing to enter the goblin camp where they suspect they will find Numlash the Irritable, who their goblin prisoner claims to work for. Henri has just killed a treeborne sentry with a Command spell.


### The woods
The party begins walking down the road, and before long they hear distant conversation and see smoke over the horizon. The more observant members of the party can see a few short, green figures milling about in the distance, if they strain their eyes.

To get a better perspective, Zelvar attempts to climb a tree, but he can't find any obvious purchase, and circles the trunk a few times. After watching Zelvar for a few moments, Tenoch throws his goblin prisoner to the ground, pushes Zelvar aside, and grabs a high branch to pull himself up. As he strains, a loud crack sounds, and he is on his back with a tree limb in his claws. Henri steps around Tenoch, wraps his stubby arms and legs around the trunk, and shimmies a bit, but can't seem to move more than a few inches before falling off. Barent slams the pointed end of his warhammer into the trunk above his head, drags himself up to eye-level with it, then realizes he has no way to get any higher and lets himself down. Veria and the still-hogtied goblin look on quizzically. After dusting himself off, Tenoch finds a stronger branch and hauls his massive lizard form up into the canopy, where he sees a rough camp in the distance at the base of a cliff.

### Goblin camp
Tenoch descends from the tree, re-shoulders his prisoner, and starts walking in the direction of the smoke. The rest of the group follows him, content to trust his judgment. They approach within fifty feet of the camp, where Tenoch halts and drops and ungags his hostage, who cowers beneath Tenoch's thoughtful gaze. From this vantage point, seven goblins are visible, milling about a motley collection of tents and a pair of cookfires. Just behind the camp yawns the dark mouth of a cave in the cliff face.

Veria focuses for a moment, her brow rumples, and she tells the group that she can sense warding magic somewhere to the left of the cave's entrance. Tenoch has been lost in thought for half a minute, but finally seems to resolve to a course of action. He grabs his prisoner by the neck, roars in his face, and lobs him in a soaring arc into the center of the camp. The goblin screams the whole way, landing crumpled in a gibbering heap, and the members of the party not already running into the camp see some of his compatriots start to drag him back into the cave.

Per usual, Tenoch leads the charge. The group engages five goblins in the camp, variously arrayed with knives and bows. Barent mutters a spell under his breath and waves his hand, and one of the goblins stops in its tracks, no longer aware of what it was doing. Before it can regain its composure, Zelvar sprints forward and decapitates it. Now at the front of the group, Zelvar and Tenoch are peppered with arrows, Zelvar taking one hit, and Tenoch taking two. Enraged, Tenoch hooks his claws under a nearby goblin's chin and rips its mandible right out of the socket; it falls over, gurgling in pain. From behind a wall at the edge of the camp, Henri fires his crossbow into the fray, but his shot goes wide and almost hits Tenoch. Distracted by the bolt whizzing by his face, Tenoch is too late to stop a goblin's dagger from punching through his thigh. Running forward, Veria fires off two missiles, one taking a goblin in the shoulder 

 Barent rushes forward, incanting the same spell he cast before, and arrests a goblin in its tracks, steps away from stabbing Tenoch in the back. Tenoch spins around and rakes his claws across his would-be attacker's face and chest, then grabs the hand still holding on to the dagger in his leg. He lifts his assailant into the air and crushes its chest with his jaws.



 puts two of them in succession into magical stupors, one of whom is immediately decapitated by Zelvar's scimitar. Veria fires off a pair of magic missiles, and again Zelvar cuts one down. Tenoch claws a goblin's face in, and Henri fires off a crossbow bolt, missing wildly. The remaining archers
