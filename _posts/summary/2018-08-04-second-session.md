We rejoin our heroes in the forest, preparing to enter the goblin camp where
they suspect they will find Numlash the Irritable, who their goblin prisoner
claims to work for. Henri has just killed a treeborne sentry with a Command
spell.

### The woods
The party begins walking down the road, and before long they hear
distant conversation and see smoke over the horizon. The more observant
members of the party can see a few short, green figures milling about in
the distance, if they strain their eyes.

To get a better perspective, Zelvar attempts to climb a tree, but he can't
find any obvious purchase, and circles the trunk a few times looking for a
way up. After watching Zelvar for a few moments, Tenoch throws his goblin
prisoner to the ground, pushes Zelvar aside, and grabs a high branch to pull
himself up. As he strains, a loud crack sounds, and he is on his back with a
tree limb in his claws. Henri steps around Tenoch, wraps his stubby arms and
legs around the trunk, and shimmies a bit, but can't seem to move more than
a few inches before falling off. Barent slams the pointed end of his
warhammer into the trunk above his head, drags himself up to eye-level with
it, then realizes he has no way to get any higher and lets himself down.
Veria and the still-hogtied goblin look on quizzically. After dusting
himself off, Tenoch finds a stronger branch and hauls his massive lizard
form up into the canopy, where he sees a rough camp in the distance at the
base of a cliff.

### Goblin camp
Tenoch descends from the tree, re-shoulders his prisoner, and starts walking
in the direction of the smoke. The rest of the group follows him, content to
trust his judgment. They approach within fifty feet of the camp, where
Tenoch halts and drops and ungags his hostage, who cowers beneath his
thoughtful gaze. From this vantage point, seven goblins are visible, milling
about a motley collection of tents and a pair of cookfires. Just behind the
camp yawns the dark mouth of a cave in the cliff face.

Veria focuses for a moment, her brow rumples, and she tells the group that
she can sense warding magic somewhere to the left of the cave's entrance.
Tenoch has been lost in thought for half a minute, but finally seems to
resolve to a course of action. He grabs his prisoner by the neck, roars in
his face, and lobs him in a soaring arc into the center of the camp. The
goblin screams the whole way, landing crumpled in a gibbering heap, and the
members of the party not already running into the camp see some of his
compatriots start to drag him back into the cave.

Per usual, Tenoch leads the charge. The group engages five goblins in the
camp, variously arrayed with knives and bows. Barent mutters a spell under
his breath and waves his hand, and one of the goblins stops in its tracks,
no longer aware of what it was doing. Before it can regain its composure,
Zelvar sprints forward and decapitates it. Now at the front of the group,
Zelvar and Tenoch are peppered with arrows slung by archers arrayed about
the near firepit. Enraged, Tenoch hooks his claws under a nearby goblin's
chin and rips its mandible right out of the socket; it falls over, gurgling
in pain. From behind a wall at the edge of the camp, Henri fires his
crossbow into the fray, but his shot goes wide and almost hits Tenoch.
Distracted by the bolt whizzing by his face, Tenoch is too late to stop a
goblin's dagger from punching through his thigh. Veria fires off two magic
missiles, one taking a goblin in the shoulder and the other slamming into
its another's gut, giving Zelvar an opportunity to impale it with his
scimitar. Barent rushes forward, incanting the same spell he cast before,
and arrests a goblin in its tracks, steps away from stabbing Tenoch in the
back. Tenoch spins around and rakes his claws across his would-be attacker's
face and chest, then grabs the hand still holding on to the dagger in his
leg. He lifts his assailant into the air and crushes its chest with his jaws.

The party pauses to breathe for a moment, having successfully annihilated
every goblin in sight. Before ten seconds pass, however, two more green
forms are sprinting out of the cave, daggers raised. They freeze in their
tracks when they see Tenoch's towering form lumbering towards them and the
carnage in his wake. Before the pair can decide what to do, Veria, Barent,
and Tenoch rush them. As they collide, Barent's warhammer slams into the
chest of the right-hand goblin, and Veria nearly cuts it in half. Tenoch's
claws rip the remaining enemy to shreds.

With no more enemies forthcoming from the cave, the party takes its time
picking through the spoils of their battle, finding a few handfuls of gold
and more ratty goblin gear, which Tenoch piles up in the center of the camp.
Henri intones a healing spell for each Tenoch and Zelvar, and the gravest of
their wounds disappear. While divvying up the gold, the party begins
discussing how much a single gold coin can buy, and realizes that despite their
shared desires for finely-crafted weapons and powerful magical reagents, a
good goat could be had in most towns for no more than 1gp&mdash;they might
be served well to take several hundred goats along to their next adventure.
It is decided that 'Gold Point' monetary denomination shall be rechristened
'Goat Points', to the amusement of all (save Tenoch, for whom even Henri's
gesticulations cannot suffice to convey the humor).


### Numlash's cave
Zelvar notices now that their former prisoner has crawled to the mouth of
the cave, perhaps in response to sounds of laughter about goats outside. He
points this out to the group, and they quickly recall their actual reason
for coming this way. The group approaches the cave entrance, and as their
eyes adjust to the dim light inside, a room takes shape, its walls and floor
hewn roughly out of the rock, the floor covered with all variety of items.
Four goblins watch them closely as they enter. One is their ex-prisoner, now
largely ignored as the group steps through into the cool underground air.
Another is tall for his race, perhaps four feet upright. The other two flank
the tall one with weapons drawn as he reclines in a once-ornate,
now-weathered armchair. A dog lies next to him, growling.

Focused on the goblin in the chair, Tenoch yells "NUMLASH!" at the top of
his lungs, pointing and flexing his claws. "Numlash? But *I'm* Numlash,"
the goblin says, visibly confused. Barent runs up to Tenoch and pulls on his
wrist, then utters a brief incantation. As he completes his spell, ~~Clarg~~
Numlash's grimace vanishes and his eyes refocus on Barent. "Friend! How
have you been?" he exclaims. Barent greets him warmly, and does his best to
convey to Tenoch that Numlash is not the primary target at the moment.
Clearly failing, he enlists Henri's help and returns his attention to
Numlash.

"I know we've known each other for the longest time and are quite good
friends, but you've never gone into detail into what it is exactly that you
do for work," Barent prods.

"Oh yeah, me and the boys, we, uh, 'liberate' travelers of their money and
nice things, if you know what I mean. We just got to put the bodies in the
back, and we can keep the rest," Numlash replies.

By this point, Tenoch and Numlash's bodyguards are all chomping at the bit,
needing to visibly restrain themselves from aiming a blow at their
respective targets. Henri has done his best to pantomime Barent casting a
spell on Numlash to Tenoch, but it doesn't seem to be getting through, or
Tenoch just doesn't care&mdash;he still wants to kill the goblin as soon as
possible. Barent notices this and comes in close to stage-whisper to
Numlash, "I just remembered, friend, that we wanted to discuss something
with you in private. Would you mind sending your boys outside for a minute?"

"What *kind* of thing?" Numlash wonders, "What do you want to talk about?"

"Oh, you know, the stuff."

"Stuff? OH! *That* stuff. Yeah, guys, can you wait outside for a minute?" he
asks.

Puzzled, his lackeys lower their weapons and walk outside, glancing back every
few steps, fully expecting to see a pair of lizard arms descending towards their
heads. But they make it outside, and Barent and Henri pull Tenoch aside. Barent
points outside, and slides his finger across his throat. Tenoch looks
uninterested in the idea, points towards Numlash, and runs his own finger
across his throat. Henri shakes his head, holds up a finger to ask for more
time, then points at Numlash and repeats the gesture. Tenoch yells,
"NUMLASH!" and points towards the goblin. Numlash asks, "Is your name Numlash
too?" Tenoch shakes his head, grumbling "Numlash..." as he turns to walk outside
and knock some goblin skulls together.

Barent, seizing the opportunity, asks Numlash what kinds of things he's
collected from the road. Numlash's face brightens. "Ooh! We have all sorts of
things. There's this," he says, as he extracts a brilliant golden religious icon
from atop a pile of refuse, which had been acting as a sort of makeshift display
stand for it. "And this thing," he preens, as he flourishes a highly-polished
silver mirror.

"Wow, look at&mdash; *CRASH* &mdash;that! Very impressive," Barent says. He
hesitates for a moment, hoping that Numlash isn't too worried about the noise
Tenoch is generating outside the cave. Henri interjects, "Do you have anything
written? Notes or similar?"

Numlash obliges: "Oh yeah, we have a bunch of that stuff. I never knew what to
do with em, but I thought they must be worth something if people with all that
money were carrying em." Numlash points out a pile of drooping parchment, damp
and in some places moldy from the cave air. Henri rushes over, entranced by the
amount of text he might be able to extract and analyze. He quickly determines
that most of the usable parchment is inscribed with low-power spells and
cantrips.

"Numlash," Barent questions, "you mentioned that you had to put the people's
bodies in the back&mdash;why do you have to do that?"

"Oh, yeah, I thought you were with him. You tell him I'm doing my
part, I'm putting all the bodies in the back, all tinact, just like he
said."

"Like *who* said, Numlash?" Henri presses.

"The boss. Here, I kept the note." He fishes a dog-eared piece of parchment out
from under his chair and flourishes it at Henri, who snatches it and reads it
aloud for everyone to hear:

> Numlash, your title is well earned.
>
> Your job is simple enough that a child could do it. All I want is for the
> bodies to be intact. Do you understand what "intact" means? It means no
> missing limbs or fingers whatsoever.
>
> You can keep all the worthless items you want from the dead but leave their
> bodies for me. Any future mistakes and I might forget our little arrangement.
> I might use your body instead.
>
> Why not keep this note close by as a reminder of your incompetence?
>
> \- Mayes

"Who is Mayes?" Henri asks.

"He's the boss. Don't you work for him?" Numlash asks, clearly puzzled.

"No, we don't, Numlash, but he's been in contact with us, so we can pass along
your message to him. Could you show us where you keep the bodies?" Barent says.

Numlash leads them down a short corridor in the back of the cave, and the group
enters a smallish, ovoid room with a pile of bodies on the floor. The group
pokes around, but doesn't find anything of particular interest.

"Where does Mayes take the bodies, Numlash?" Barent questions.

"Oh, right here." Numlash depresses a button hidden in a crag in the stone, and
a door swings open out of the rock.


### Mayes' room
Peering in, the party sees a long room with a summoning circle on the floor, two
cages against the right wall, and two animated skeletons rushing straight for
them. Just as the group enters the room, Tenoch appears, poking his face around
the corner into the mausoleum behind, and sprints forward as the skeletons close
in.

As the party reorients itself for battle, Henri has the presence of mind to yell
to Numlash, "They've gone rogue! You have to help us kill them, Numlash, or
Mayes won't like it!"

Numlash ponders for a second, then pouts. "No! I don't wanna."

While his back is turned, Henri receives a scimitar to the shoulder. "Look what
he's done to me!", he yells, looking pointedly at Numlash. The exclamation
similarly fails to move the goblin.

Veria notices that one of the cages along the wall has a living woman in it 
(and the other a dessicated skeleton). She runs to the first cage, yelling,
"We're trying to help you, but I'm going to look scary for a second," then 
grows horns and claws, and tries to pulls the bars apart. Unfortunately, they
don't budge.

Meanwhile, Zelvar and Barent unleash a pair of blows against the skeletons, the
elf connecting solidly, while the dwarf swings into the air. Tenoch, still
running, smashes through them, roars, and shatters the ribcages of both
skeletons with a pair of blows, ending the combat. 

Tenoch then walks over to the cage Veria is working on and punches it. The
impact cracks a pair of rivets holding bars in place, allowing them to be worked
out of the way so the woman can escape.

Veria begins questioning her, first recognizing that she looks similar to Rowan
and connecting the dots: "Hi, I know we just broke you out of a cage in a dark
cave with a summoning circle in it, but we need to know some things. Are you
Aida? We know your brother, Rowan."  The woman reveals that she is Aida, but
she doesn't understand why they were with Rowan and not her other brothers.
Veria explains that her other brothers are away, and Rowan came to them.

Veria asks for more information before telling her everything, and Aida relates
what is more-or-less the story Rowan told them: her parents didn't approve of
her plans, and she never wanted to be a farmer. She wanted something more
fulfilling, so she snuck out and made friends her parents didn't like. Aida
also reveals, after some hesitation, that she did meet someone who seemed to
understand. He knew magic, and he taught her some. A week ago, Aida got angry at
her father, and she yelled at him and left the house.

Veria tells Aida that her parents are dead, that they got sick, and Henri
chimes in that someone tried to heal them with an Animate Dead ritual. Aida
starts sobbing. Veria asks who it was that she met that taught her magic.
Unsurprisingly, it was Mayes. Aida didn't know that the spell she had cast was
Animate Dead.

Veria recounts the story of the party's involvement up until now, but Aida is
still confused about why her brothers weren't at the farm. The party
collectively realizes that they may have marched off in the army they saw at
the square in Aldenburn, and suggests that this is where they may have gone.
Still sobbing, Aida asks Veria if she's ever wished she could just take
something back.

Numlash pokes his head in, interested in what's been going on. "I've never
really *seen* this room before." He strokes his chin.

Henri now walks up to Aida and asks if she knows what Mayes is up to, or if
he's working with anyone. She doesn't know what his plan is, but she's pretty
sure he has allies. She walks over to a chest and pulls out a plain mask, whose
only features are holes for the eyes and mouth, and a robe, mentioning that
Mayes would sometimes wear these items.

{%- include block_image.html url="/assets/images/mayes_mask_robe.jpg"
name="Mayes'Mask and Robes" -%}

Holding the mask, Henri meditates, but isn't able to determine what it is, even
with his divine aid. He then spies a statuette in a form that seems familiar on
an altar near the far end of the room. It is an avian figure whose face and
beak are replaced with a plague doctor's mask. Henri enters a trance again, and
recalls that this form evokes Gibbet, the god of decay. He investigates the
altar, and senses an evil energy emanating from it&mdash;one that
wouldn't ordinarily strike an observer as magical, but would cause unease
nonetheless.

Veria focuses briefly, then points out a handful of magical auras in and around
the room to the rest of the group. The altar seems touched with deathly energy,
a pile of scrolls in a far corner emanates transmuting and warding magic, and a
ward of some sort is just outside the door at the far end of the room.

Henri scurries over to the pile of parchment, discovering a pair of books
that pique his interest. First, a dungeoneer's guide containing illustrations
of critters one might encounter on the road and a long list of DOs and DON'Ts
for safe adventuring. He skims this, but loses interest and hands it off to
Zelvar. The second book is a massive tome entitled "The Grim Trio", which he
cracks here and there, then excitedly stuffs in his knapsack.

The rest of the pile contains a few low-powered scrolls, which Henri, Veria, and
Barent divide amongst themselves. The group then looks in the chest from which
the robe and mask were extracted, and find a small lockbox containing a hefty
sum of gold.


### Ezra
Cut to a whistling human, wandering down a path in the forest near Numlash's
cave. As he rounds a corner, he nearly trips on a dead goblin,
but catches himself, gives it a hefty kick, and walks on, still whistling. He
approaches the goblin camp our adventurers decimated, and picks through the
carnage. When he is satisfied that all the greenskins are dead, he ruffles
through a pouch around his waist and pulls out a scrap of parchment, which
reads:

> **NUMLASH THE IRRITABLE**
>
> Wanted dead or alive.
>
> Reward of 1,000 gold pieces for capture.

He smiles, pockets the note, and whistles into the cave. 

The man immediately spots a goblin balled up on the floor, badly injured and
whimpering to itself. He whips a cutlass out of its scabbard and lops its head
off, then saunters down towards the back end of the room, through the corridor,
and into the body-dumping room, where he can see through the door into Mayes'
chamber.

"Hello! Is Numlash the Irritable here?" he yells.

Barent walks past Numlash, who is at the door, and points at him, "Yes,
this is him right here, what do you want with him?"

"I'd like his body, but you can kill him if you'd like," he offers.

Barent nods at Tenoch, pointing at Numlash. Tenoch springs off his haunches and
decapitates the goblin leader with a few deft twists, turns, and slices of his
claws. He puts the head into his bag.

"Now hold on," the man protests, "I need that."

"Why?" Barent asks him.

"Because of the bounty, of course. My name is Ezra Monterosso, and I have
dispensation to collect a bounty on this goblin. If you like, we can split it
fifty-fifty?" he suggests.

Henri laughs. "You ought to be negotiating with Tenoch there."

Tenoch perks up. He reaches for Ezra's hand, shakes it, and says a few words of
Draconic. He then executes his secret technique, "questioning lizard", and Henri
give him a thumbs-up.

Puzzled, Ezra asks, "Does he not speak Grivian?" In response to Henri's nod, he
pauses for a moment, then points to Tenoch's pack, from which a
flap of Numlash's ear is still protruding, then to himself. Tenoch shakes
his head, points a finger at the pack, and points at the group, excluding Ezra.

Henri, now tiring of the exchange, tells Ezra, "You didn't actually do
anything. Why should we give you Numlash? I tell you what, if you join our group
here, we'll claim the bounty together and split it evenly amongst all of us.
Consider it a signing bonus."

Ezra ventures optimistically, "And you're not part of the military?"

"Nope," confirms Henri.

"Wonderful, I'm in," Ezra says.

Numlash sorted, Aida found, and a new party member acquired, the group begins
thinking about leaving the cave. Their first avenue of exploration is the ward
Veria detected out the front door. Tenoch leads the way, and not more than a few
steps beyond the end of the room, his foot goes through a false floor and is
stuck in a trap. He eventually works himself out, not too badly wounded.

As the group advances quite close to the warding magic, Henri decides to just
walk through it. He finds himself outside the cave, but not magically affected
in any way, so he walks back in. Only at this point does he actually investigate
the spell, and he discovers it to be an Alarm, likely tied to Mayes'
consciousness.

The party loots the cave quickly, not wanting to encounter the man yet, and
hurries out the cave mouth they originally entered. On the way, bags full of
gold and other valuables, Barent chops off a finger from Numlash, and a toe from
the party's erstwhile prisoner, which he puts in a small pouch hanging off of
his rucksack.

Back on the trail, Veria asks Aida, "Why did Mayes keep you in a cage?
Wasn't he helping you out?" Aida responds that she thought he originally wanted
to help her, but now she thinks she might have been turned into one of "them",
but she doesn't want to think about it.

The group reacquires Rowan from his hiding spot, then asks Aida if they have
any family around. They do, further south along the main road, which is
agreeable to everyone, so they start walking in that direction.
