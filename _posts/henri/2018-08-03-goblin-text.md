#### 15th of Ai-El, 834

Ha! I command you to fall. Brilliant. Pity it would’ve sounded like gibberish to my companions, though I guess the whole bit with the pointing downwards and the goblin throwing themselves to their death would’ve gotten the point across.

Sticking with Tenoch is having some side-benefits, it seems. I knew it took a lot more training and practice to get combat-effective with bending the forces of reality to your will than to just hitting people real hard, but I never would’ve guessed just how powerful an unarmed angry Lizardman could be! Ah, I’m learning all sorts of things on this little adventure.

Seems I haven’t been giving the arcane magics a fair shake, going by the nonsense Barent just pulled off. Charming Numlash itself right after he watched an angry, screaming, bloodied Lizardman charge into his throne room? Now that’s some impressive spellcraft. Sadly, I’ll have to make do with my words alone in order to bend people to my will - unless, perhaps, I learn a bit more about these scrolls…

Looks like we’ve hit the motherlode. Necromantic rituals, never-before-seen decay-cults, non-magical altars that still emit Necromantic and esoteric auras, and a collection of scrolls and genuine books to top it off! Honestly, this place has made me feel a bit self-conscious about the holes in my own education - my cosmopolitan-and-spellcraft background has left me woefully unprepared to investigate all of these religious icons and general arcana, even with the aid of my oracular mysteries. At least the books we picked up should help patch some of the gaps in my knowledge.

Somehow, in this entire compound, we have failed to find a single scrap of Goblin writings. It even Goblins are not immune to the effects of Grivian imperialism. If I ever want to learn their tongue, I’m either going to need to find some encampments still untouched by the influences of these civilized nations, or… urgh… learn from a goblin themself. ...Perhaps  I might find some way to extract some information directly from their minds? Surely that would be easier than attempting to accept tutelage from one of the daft greenskins.

We’ve learned a fair amount about this zombie cult since we got here - they need shipments of bodies for something, that bastard Mayes is seducing ignorant children to the dark side with false promises of forbidden knowledge, the god Gibbet is involved with them somehow, and Lizardfolk make for far better muscle than Goblins. And we also have handwriting samples from both Numlash and Mayes, which fills me with excitement. Oh, the orders we could falsify… Ah, but I’m getting ahead of myself. We still lack leads on where this mysterious cult houses all of its forbidden lore and probably leaders, which leaves us in a bit of a pickle. Perhaps we can try interrogating Aida further, or maybe return to Numlash’s camp and attempt to track whoever set that alarm? Well, these are questions for later. For now, it is time to rest.
