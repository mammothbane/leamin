#### It is the 14th of Ai-El; a Càirnday with hardly a cloud in the sky. The year is 834.

The Grivian Empire is a proud and mighty Empire, led by His Imperial Majesty Olyn Solian IV. The year is young,
and festivals for the harvest have begun to be celebrated across the land,  but rumors have already begun to
plague 3 every inn and tavern across this glorious Empire.

To the north, dwarven soldiers from the Kingdom of Dwarmak have begun to rapidly mobilize towards the western
coast. The Elves of Sylath watch from the shadows of the Scarletwood, caught between Dwarmak and the Empire.

To the south, the mages of Indilia meddle with arcane forces beyond their understanding, and travelers from the
swampy forests of Uryahd bring with them rumors of brewing unrest and rebellion. In the Stony Sea, pirates sail
the oceans, venturing forth from their secret ports and lawless havens. Bandits and brigands watch the roads,
hoping to steal from any poor soul they find.

Across the Brinewater, the Kingdom of Sealan hoards its gold to be divided among an increasingly irritable royal
family. All the while, the holy teachings of the Grand Temple in Terodaana seem to fall on increasingly uncaring
ears.

There has been no word of the diplomats sent some time ago to the Kingdom of Dwarmak, and the Arch-General,
Elijah Farellian, Guildmaster of the Imperial Guild of Military and Defense, has promised to deliver a swift
justice to the Empire’s enemies. He has summoned the Empire’s forces to Grivia, where the Empire will bless
their campaign against Dwarmak.

Trouble brews at the edges of the Empire, but the violence and chaos of this world are held back by the strength
of the Imperial Guilds and the wisdom of our Emperor. But make no mistake, when the Imperial armies march north
to Dwarmak the world will be reminded that the Grivian Empire stands at the center of this land.

These troubled times will be met by heroic individuals. The road is open, and the world is yours.

### Aldenburn
In the city of Aldenburn in the Grivian Empire, an army prepares to march to war. According to the crowds that have
gathered to watch, they’ll meet up with Arch-General Farellian in Grivia along with armies from across the Empire, and
he’ll lead them to Dwarmak to confront the dwarven kingdom; considering the hostility between the two nations, this will
almost certainly result in all-out war. The army leaving Aldenburn is led by one of Farellian’s sons, and the other 
takes charge of the city.

As the army departs, five adventurers are swept up together in the crowd:

- **Tenoch**, a lizardfolk barbarian from Uryahd
- **Henri Shortfellow**, a halfling oracle from Indilia
- **Barent Lockerhelm**, a dwarf witch from Dwaeval
- **Zelvar Hutha**, an elf ranger from Sylath
- **Veria Tenumbri**, a human sorcerer from Aldenburn

Preparing to leave for points unknown, Tenoch bumps into a small child, who drops a few bags of coins. The child tries
to get Tenoch's attention, but Tenoch doesn't speak a word of Common, so a nearby shopkeeper translates the boy's
entreaty&mdash;he is looking for a group of adventurers to aid his sick family. Tenoch says he will help, and the 
members of our nascent party overhear and offer their aid as well: Veria, eager to leave the military ambiance 
of the city square behind, indicates that she is moving south anyway and needs money to travel; Henri is interested in
expanding his knowledge (particularly of languages) and is determined to follow Tenoch, whose native Draconic and Uryahdi
have eluded him thus far; Barent simply wants a change of pace from lugging salted fish through the Grivian interior; 
and Zelvar is swayed by the boy's offers of coin and a vague sense of moral duty. The boy gives his name (Rowan),
and he climbs up onto Tenoch's back as the group sets out for a checkpoint at the city's southern wall.

The guards at the checkpoint are consulting a list as they examine departing travelers. Veria attempts to disguise
herself, fearing that she might be recognized. The guards, however, stop Tenoch and Rowan. An interpreter is found for
Tenoch, and the pair's bags are searched. Rowan attempts to defend a small knapsack, but he loses control of it and drops 
a healing potion, which shatters on the ground. He is accused of stealing, as a shopkeeper reported a theft of such a
potion by a young boy earlier that day. Rowan offers a feeble defense, verging on babbling about his sick family. He is 
saved by Henri, who claims that he is the alchemist who brewed the potion. The guards believe him, and the party is
allowed to move beyond the gates. In response to Rowan's apology for making such a mess, Henri only tells him to prepare
a better excuse the next time around.


### Beyond the walls
The party continues down the road, and Tenoch's long stride quickly leaves the majority of the group behind. Just as Rowan
is suggesting that he slow down, a goblin appears from the bushes, demanding payment. Tenoch is unable to understand it
but recognizes its aggression so he scares it off with a roar. The goblin scampers away, and as the rest of the
adventuring group catches up, several of them overhear muttering in the bushes. Four goblins leap out of the underbrush
and set upon our heroes. Two of them, furthest down the path, are armed with crossbows, and the remaining two have
swords.

Tenoch barrels past the sword-wielders and engages with the crossbowmen, while the rest of the party focuses on the
nearer foes. Veria slashes at one of them with a longsword, but misses and is stabbed for her trouble. She yells in pain
and begins to grow claws and horns, and her eyes begin to glow. She strikes back with her claws. Barent smacks a goblin 
over the head with his warhammer, and Henri, lagging behind, arrives in time to incant a healing spell for Veria. In 
this time, Tenoch has eviscerated his targets, and he throws one of the corpses at one of the remaining goblins. Veria 
finishes off her enemy, and the remaining greenskin surrenders, terrified.

The group loots the corpses of its fallen comrades and find some gold, herbs, and shoddy weapons, as well as a note that
says:

> Blok de rode, inbush trabelers, ete dis noate wunse yu rede it.

Zelvar interrogates the party's new prisoner, demanding to know who gave him his orders. After some persuading,
the goblin reveals that he works for 'Numlash', who Henri reveals (after a moment of intense focus) to be Numlash the
Irritable, the leader of a troop of goblins who have been harassing travelers in the area for some time. The group
resolves to keep the prisoner around, hoping that he will be of use as a hostage or source of further information. 
Tenoch tucks him under one arm and puts Rowan on his back, and everyone continues on down the road.


### Rowan's farm
After walking for some time, Rowan informs the group that they are nearing his farm. When they arrive, they are greeted
with a gruesome scene. Scattered about the small farmhouse are dead livestock lying in pools of their own blood. Zelvar
notices small bite marks at their necks. With some trepidation, Tenoch and Barent enter the farmhouse, but it is empty
of occupants, and, Rowan reports, contains no more blood than when he left. As the rest of the party files in, Barent
steps to the door and focuses for a moment. A hawk (Carl) unmelds from his back, and he releases it outside to patrol
for enemies.

Veria asks Rowan what kind of sickness his parents had, and he explains that his father was coughing up blood, raving in
his sleep, and generally not himself. His sister had run away a few days ago, but they couldn't search for her because
everyone was sick. Veria searches the house herself and finds a note in Rowan's sister's room that reads "I am so sorry."

Meanwhile Tenoch, still carrying the goblin prisoner, has gone on to search the barn. He hears chewing noises from
inside, so he roars and runs in. A zombie is eating a horse on the floor, and when it sees Tenoch, it charges at him.
Tenoch drops the goblin, shreds the zombie with his claws, then picks up the goblin again. The rest of the group runs in,
alarmed by his roar. Another zombie is found in a side room, and it is dispatched swiftly by Veria's magic missile, 
Zelvar's scimitar, and Tenoch's claws, though in the process, Zelvar is knocked unconscious. Henri remedies this with
a quick healing spell.

The rest of the barn is quickly checked, and it becomes evident that these two zombies were indeed Rowan's parents. The
boy is distraught, so Veria stays to offer comfort while the rest of the group performs a more thorough search of the
building. They find a chest containing gold and personal effects, which are conveyed to Rowan, and Barent senses a
magic aura in the loft. The group finds a ritual circle, which Henri determines is drawn for Animate Dead, though it is
crude, as if the caster was a total novice. Tenoch and Henri destroy the circle, and they speculate that Rowan's
sister most likely had something to do with this. As the group leaves the barn, Barent discreetly relays what they found
to Veria, who agrees with their suspicion of Rowan's sister. Zelvar leans on his survival training in an attempt to track
her, and comes to the conclusion that she likely went south. Rowan says that they were told never to go there, as the
woods in that direction are dangerous.

After following a path for some time, the party stops and makes camp, hoping that they are far from whatever lurking
danger Rowan's parents had warned him about. They tie up their goblin prisoner for the night.


### The next day
In the morning, Veria talks to Rowan about his sister. They are both half elves&mdash;Rowan is 13 and Aida, his sister,
is a young adult now. She never wanted to be a farmer, but she didn't want to go off to war like her brothers either.
She often wandered where she wasn't supposed to, and their parents didn't like the company she kept.

The party sets off down the path they were following yesterday, until their goblin prisoner protests that they shouldn't
go this way. Tenoch drops him so that he can take them the way they're *not* supposed to go, so he knows not to go there.
Eventually, the group leads them to a place in the woods that evidently marks the border of some goblin territory&mdash;
a skull hangs from a tree branch, and crude images of goblins are painted on the trees and rocks. The group infers that
this is Numlash's territory and prepares to move into it. Veria reminds everyone that they can't just take Rowan into a
battle, so they find him a place to hide until they come back.

Tenoch, ever in the front, holds the prisoner over his head and roars, running down the path. This garners the attention
of a nearby sentry in a tree, who fires a few arrows from his bow until Henri Commands him to fall. He dies instantly
when he hits the ground. The group prepares to fight their way into the goblin village.
