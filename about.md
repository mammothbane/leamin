Sup. We play D&D.

Currently, I'm just formatting and uploading our session summaries, written up by the wonderful
[Aethira](http://aethira.tumblr.com/) with light edits and formatting by me. Character sheets, maps, miscellaenous art, 
etc. may also go here eventually.

I don't know anyone else who has social media presence or would give a shit, but if I did I'd definitely link them here.
